Creates a section object. 

 A section object represents a section of memory that can be shared. A process can use a section object to share parts of its memory address space (memory sections) with other processes. 

 Section objects also provide the mechanism by which a process can map a file into its memory address space. 

 Each memory section has one or more corresponding views. A view of a section is a part of the section that is actually visible to a process. The act of creating a view for a section is known as mapping a view of the section. 

 Each process that is manipulating the contents of a section has its own view; a process can also have multiple views (to the same or different sections).</td></tr><tr><td>![Public method](media/pubmethod.gif "Public method")![Static member](media/static.gif "Static member")</td><td><a href="M_DevCase_Interop_Unmanaged_Win32_NativeMethods_NtCreateSection_1">NtCreateSection(IntPtr, GenericAccessRights, ObjectAttributes, UInt64, MemoryProtectionOptions, SectionAttributes, IntPtr)</a></td><td>
