Determine the similarity percentage that the specified Size has with a square shape, by dividing its shortest side between the longest one. 

 For example, having a Size of 4x4 (Width x Height), this function will return a value of 1, meaning that all the sides ( {Top=4, Bottom=4, Left=4, Right=4} ) are of equal length, or in other words, it is a perfect square shape. 

 For example too, having a Size of 640x480 (Width x Height), this function will return a value of 0.75, meaning that the length of the sides ( {Top=640, Bottom=640, Left=480, Right=480} ) are 75% near to be a perfect square shape.</td></tr><tr><td>![Public method](media/pubmethod.gif "Public method")![Static member](media/static.gif "Static member")![Code example](media/CodeExample.png "Code example")</td><td><a href="M_DevCase_Core_Imaging_Tools_DrawingUtil_GetSquareSimilarityPercentage_1">GetSquareSimilarityPercentage(Int32, Int32)</a></td><td>
