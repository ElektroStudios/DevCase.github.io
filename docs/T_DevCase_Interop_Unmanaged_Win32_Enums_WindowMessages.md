# WindowMessages Enumeration
 

The system sends or posts a system-defined message when it communicates with an application. 

 It uses these messages to control the operations of applications and to provide input and other information for applications to process. 

 An application can also send or post system-defined messages. 

 Applications generally use these messages to control the operation of control windows created by using preregistered window classes.
