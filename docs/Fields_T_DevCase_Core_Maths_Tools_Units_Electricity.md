An ampere (symbol: A; abbreviated as amp) is a unit of electric current. 

 The ampere is that constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed one metre apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to 2×10^−7 newtons per metre of length.</td></tr><tr><td>![Public field](media/pubfield.gif "Public field")![Static member](media/static.gif "Static member")</td><td><a href="F_DevCase_Core_Maths_Tools_Units_Electricity_Coulomb">Coulomb</a></td><td>
A coulomb (symbol: C) is a derived unit of electric charge. 

 It is the charge (symbol: Q or q) transported by a constant current of one ampere in one second.</td></tr><tr><td>![Public field](media/pubfield.gif "Public field")![Static member](media/static.gif "Static member")</td><td><a href="F_DevCase_Core_Maths_Tools_Units_Electricity_Farad">Farad</a></td><td>
A farad (symbol: Pa) is a derived unit of electrical capacitance, the ability of a body to store an electrical charge. 

 One farad is defined as the capacitance across which, when charged with one coulomb, there is a potential difference of one volt.</td></tr><tr><td>![Public field](media/pubfield.gif "Public field")![Static member](media/static.gif "Static member")</td><td><a href="F_DevCase_Core_Maths_Tools_Units_Electricity_Ohm">Ohm</a></td><td>
An ohm (symbol: Ω) is a derived unit of electrical resistance. 

 The ohm is defined as an electrical resistance between two points of a conductor when a constant potential difference of 1 volt, applied to these points, produces in the conductor a current of 1 ampere, the conductor not being the seat of any electromotive force.</td></tr><tr><td>![Public field](media/pubfield.gif "Public field")![Static member](media/static.gif "Static member")</td><td><a href="F_DevCase_Core_Maths_Tools_Units_Electricity_Volt">Volt</a></td><td>
A volt (symbol: V) is a derived unit for electric potential, electric potential difference (voltage), and electromotive force. 

 One volt is defined as the difference in electric potential between two points of a conducting wire when an electric current of one ampere dissipates one watt of power between those points.</td></tr></table>&nbsp;
